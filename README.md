# words-cli
A command line tool for learning new words.

Have your GRE / GMAT / SAT / RandomVocabularyTest coming up? Or just simply want to improve your understanding of the English language.

This is a CLI tool which randomly selects a word from the Barron's High Frequency (i.e. important) word list, and tells you its meaning.
